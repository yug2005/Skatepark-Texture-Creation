# Skatepark Texture Creation

## Summary 

This texture creation project in Adobe Substance Painter contains the main *Adobe Substance Painter 3D Project* (`.spp`) file and the texture sets created for the 3D model of a skatepark. 

Note : The texture sets were exported for Unreal Engine 4 and the emissive texture map was excluded as the final model did not have any emissive textures. 

## Contents

The following details the content of the files and folders. 

### Project Images

### Vehicle

This is the main *Adobe Substance Painter 3D Project* (`.spp`) file. It can be opened with recent versions of Adobe Substance Painter.
